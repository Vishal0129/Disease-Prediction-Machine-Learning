# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Introduction

- This project is based on the idea of predicting the disease of a patient based on the symptoms he/she is facing.
- The dataset used for this project is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset).
- The dataset contains 4920 rows and 132 columns.
- The dataset contains the name of the disease, the symptoms of the disease and the description of the disease.
- The dataset is in the form of a csv file.

## Procedure
- The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed.
- The dataset is then split into training and testing data.
- The training data is then used to train the model.
- The model is then tested on the testing data.
- The model is then used to predict the disease of a patient based on the symptoms he/she is facing.
